Want to make Fort Collins better? We've got a Hackathon for that.

FORT COLLINS, Colo., July 1, 2016 -- Code For FoCo, a new Fort Collins-based civic tech organization, hosts its inaugural hackathon Friday July 8.

The hackathon is the first in a series of launch events sponsored by Code For FoCo. The organization brings hackers, designers, artists, and others together to solve challenges faced by the local community.

“Fort Collins has a growing tech community. The goal of this hackathon is to bring that community together,” said Code For FoCo founder Jordan Majdolashrafi.

At the hackathon, participants will be presented with a custom domain name with a theme courtesy of Name.com. Whichever team builds the most creative site will win the hackathon and additional prizes donated by Name.com.

The free event is from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday, July 8. Pizza and drinks will be provided.

It will take place at Galvanize Fort Collins, 242 Linden St, Fort Collins, CO 80524.

There is no charge to participate and registration will take place on site. Teams will be randomly assigned, but pairs of participants may request to be grouped together.
