This is the second installment of "lightning talks" as part of the FCx collaboration, held on Febuary 5, 2020. For more information, see [the project at the Our City portal](https://ourcity.fcgov.com/open-data).

## What was presented?

How the Census data is used in our community.

### City of Fort Collins

**Tim Campbell**
_OpenData Project Manager_
This is the first time that the census can be filled out online, the data is confidential and cannot be used for law enforcement.

### State of Colorado

**Elizabeth Garner**
_State Demographer_
Highlighted some population trends in Colorado:

-   Colorado has about 5.7 million residents; expected to grow at 1.4%, which is about twice national rate (slowest US growth rate since 1930s Great Depression)
-   Native births contribute more to the CO population growth than migration; compared to the average resident, migrants are younger, lower income, higher educational attainment

### Health District of Larimer County

**Suman Mathur**
_Evaluator & Data Analyst_

-   An uncounted person represents a loss of ~\$2,200/year in public funding. CO received \$15 billion for health and human services through 55 federal spending programs in 2016.
-   Health District of Larimer County conducts a tri-annual survey on a sample population, uses Census data to extrapolate needs of general population in our community

### City of Fort Collins

**"Ryan"**
The city uses Census data everywhere...but more specifically:

-   Apportioning the 6 city council districts; there can't be more than a 10% difference in population among the districts
-   Sidewalk prioritization or community garden locations: the city takes location of vulnerable populations into account along with other factors

### Q&A, Fun Facts

-   Children and students (west of CSU campus) are most likely to be uncounted in the Census
-   Millennials killed everything
-   Census questions are relatively stable, difficult to add questions to the Census

## Everyone counts, taking part in the census is your civic duty!
