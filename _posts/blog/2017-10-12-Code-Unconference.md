Unconference? What the heck is that? Well, I'll be able to tell you in more detail after I attend the Code For America Brigade Congress in beautiful Philadelphia, PA. Cue the music.<!--more-->

## I Get to Go to CFA Brigade Congress :)

Apparently this is the first one too! A gracious travel grant from our parent organization has allowed me to go see what the rest of the country's brigades are up to, how they are succeeding and improving their communities, and what the future of the organization might be. As an "unconference," I couldn't even begin to tell you what I'm going to learn! We are in uncharted territory. Attendees will be offering up ideas for sessions on the day they happen. I'm hoping to be able to talk about our successes and challenges as a volunteer group so far. Our change to supporting multiple projects at the same time has been a success, and I want to share that story and see how other brigades deal with engaging new members and keeping interest and progress moving from week to week.

I'll be coming back after the congress to write about my experience and learnings. There may even be pictures. Wish me good luck, and use the Connect links below if you want to ask me some questions about the trip or tell me to get some answers while I'm in sunny Philadelphia.
