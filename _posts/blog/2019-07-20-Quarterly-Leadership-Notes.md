## Fundraiser Recap

We raised $500 dollars, only about $10 of it at the event.

### How to Spend the Money

Ideas discussed:

* Appreciation lunch/dinner/etc
* Buy supplies (and nothing else)
* Buy advertising on Facebook to promote events (like with the city)
* Buy pizza for meetups and advertise it on them
* Throw a party
* Have token gift (tshirt, baseball cap, etc) for people who make 5 code pushes, attend meetings

**Proposal:** bring food to new member nights. Pizzas, platters, popcorn. Steven will manage it and ask David (etc) for help as needed. *APPROVED*

There will be pizza in August.

## Recruitment?

How to make meetings more effective for people?

Rename "Work Night" to "Project Night". Rename "New Member + Work Night"

Rework project ideas so that they're easier to find and easier to get to work on --> Add "Problem"/"Proposed Solution"/"Next Steps"/"Outcomes" as a core part of the offering on each listing

### Continue regular socials?

Yes, keep them. Where should we do them? Move them around town a little more. Wild Boar next time.

## Projects inventory and health-check

* **VolunteerCore** -- slow, stuck on the search issue
* **Firefighter Service Directory** -- David checks with Durkin about the demo
* **CERP** -- exists

## Managing Things

* Do we need more documentation of projects? "How to get this app running" is a minimum standard/goal for every project

## Filling Roles?

We've got roles, what do we do with them?

### Do we want to run elections?

We talked about a board, David will write up more of the procedure

### What are our concrete needs as an organization?

- Maintaining GitHub account (David/Steven)
- Maintain the Meetup Listings (David)
- Posting to social media (???)
- Maintain the blog (David)
- Food for meetings (Steven)

## National Day of Action (Civic Hacking) on Sat Sept 21

Alex is thinking he'll run something this day, but Steven and David aren't committing 

## Brigade Congress

- Seems that it will be the weekend of Oct 18-21 in Cleveland
- All three of us will try to go, but none of us are sure of our schedule

## Action Items

* David will check with the library about food being OK
* David will make more complete more complete documentation (blog post) about the board process
* Next time: A more complete inventory of organizational need and goals should be made
