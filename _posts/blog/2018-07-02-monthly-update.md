It's summer. But Code for Fort Collins is growing and changing! Come take part :)

## Code for America

We've been a Code for America Brigade for our whole existence. But we were never on the map due to some workflow issues. 
But we are now, proudly shown as a dot on the big Brigade map. [Check it out!](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/)

On a related sidenote, David (that's me, self-promotion alert) wrote up some thoughts about 
[what working in Code for Fort Collins has been like](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/code-for-america-brigade/).

## Thanks to Cohere

[Cohere Community](https://coherecommunity.com/) has been generously offering us free coworking space all year.
In addition, they helpfully threw a party for us (and other meetups that use the space) a party at the end of June.
The party was a great time, and a helpful to strengthen ties to the rest of the Fort Collins community.

We had about 30 attendees, and we also owe a debt of gratitude to [Women Who Code](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Fort-Collins/)
for making sure that everyone had something good to drink. Cheers to them!

## Solar Scorecard

[Solar Scorecard](http://solar-scorecard.org) is a project to track how the city of Fort Collins is doing on its renewable energy
and solar production. 
It made some big strides recently when David, Ian, and Jason got together to solve some of the most important road-blocks for the project.
Coworking at the CSU Powerhouse on Saturday (June 2), we made the site use real Fort Collin's data, live from the city's API.

As you'll see if you check the site, there's a lot of cool possibilities there, but the project could use some great words. 
(It current has none on the site.)
If you're interested in checking it out, join our Slack and post your interest in #solar-scorecard. We'd love your help!

## Leadership Matters

David, Dan, and Ian are in the process of meeting with the other Colorado Code for America Brigades of Colorado
(Code for Boulder and Code for Denver). 
We're learning a lot about how they work, and how our brigade can be better from that work. 
Hopefully, we'll continue those conversations on a consistent basis. 
We're planning to do that every-two-months.
If you're interested in joining those conversations, or leadership of our brigade, do not hesitate to reach out in Slack. 
(@davidbhayes welcomes any commentary on and channel you can find me.)
