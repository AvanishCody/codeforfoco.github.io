Code for Fort Collins wants your ideas for making the Fort Collins community better. Whether you're looking for help with providing access to information the City of Fort Collins already has, building out a product that you think the city needs, or just giving us a general problem you have that you think technology could help with.<!--more--> That jog any ideas for you? Give it to us: [http://bit.ly/2nQks7o](http://bit.ly/2nQks7o)

There are no bad ideas. We won't tell anyone about what you told us. Unless it's great. Then we may tell people you gave us the idea. If you give us permission to use your name. :)

Thanks you, Fort Collins! We're eager to make Northern Colorado even better than it already is, and we're just getting started.

[That survey](http://bit.ly/2nQks7o), one last time!
