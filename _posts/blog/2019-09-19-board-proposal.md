*This is a proposal for formalizing the way that the board of Code for Fort Collins works.*

There exists an advisory board of Code for Fort Collins which meets quarterly on the first(-ish) Saturday of months where x % 3 = 1. 
Which is a fancy way to say in January, April, July, and October (1, 4, 7, 10). 
Dates are somewhat flexible, but both captains should be in attendance, 
and an open invite should be announced in Slack at least 48 hours before a meeting in held.

In general, the board meetings are a chance to take a step back from week-to-week functioning of the organization. 
To think more completely about what the organization does, how effective it is being, and what steps can be taken to make it more useful.

The composition of the board:

* That board is chaired by the two co-captains.
* In addition, there will be five “members” chairs on the board.
These are voting seats if anything is to be decided. These seats are available to up to 5 members who attend.
* (Nonvoting) external advisory seats will be granted on a per-meeting basis to anyone who attends who is not a member.

Decision aren’t generally up for a vote. 
Participation in the board meeting is more about being thoughtful about organizational efforts, and potentially volunteering to take on some of the work that the organization needs. 
Only after a topic of conversation or action has been debated for a few cycles without a clearly mutually-agreed course of action should a vote be taken. 
(Robert’s Rules of Order and all that should be considered, but are not committed here. 
Because so far no such structure has been useful. 
In the event that it should become useful, those details should be enumerated here.)
