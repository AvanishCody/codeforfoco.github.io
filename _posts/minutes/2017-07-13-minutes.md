No meannigful non-projects business

## Project Updates

### CERP

Talked to the county clerk -- she was worried about politicization and didn't have a solution other than the PDF of data
(as a rasterized image) without any other sources. Today they are working on how to extract the data from that map.

### Solar City

Is moving to chart.js. And they had a great meeting Olivia at the city about rattling more cages to make sure that the solar data comes
out in a better format than the PDFs they have.

### Launch No.CO

Darlington is starting on his site-specific plugin and will commit tonight.

### Reclaim FoCo

No progress, the city should let us know if we move on TOMORROW!

### CFFC site

David is working on minutes.
