### Project Details
#### Election Information
Larimer County provides information about elections at a precinct level, but the information is provided as a table of statistics. We are striving to improve the explorability of the data by building a website that lets Larimer County citizens view results on a map, compare precincts, and discover ways to reach out to elected officials.

#### Detailed Project Requirements
1. Show election information on a heat map of precincts in Larimer County.
2. Display all election outcomes for a precinct on the same page.
3. Allow different "views" of the data to be shared via hyperlinks.
