I'm David. I work with WordPress a lot, speak at PHP conferences pretty regularly, 
teach people how to do WordPress development at [WPShout](https://wpshout.com/),
and generally just try to have fun. I don't work too hard.

I also like to bike, read, and play board games. Castles of Burgundy is the best board game I think.
