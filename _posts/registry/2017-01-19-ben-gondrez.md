I am currently the Digital Dome Manager at the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery. There I manage the dome operations including developing and running programs and activities, maintain the server and other A/V technology that runs the dome, as well as numerous other tech related tasks around the museum. I graduated from Colorado State University with a BS in Business Administration with a Computer Information Systems concentration.
