I currently work for the City of Fort Collins Natural Areas Department, however I am looking to change career paths and jump headfirst into tech. I've been learning to code for around 2 months through online self training. I fully believe immersion is the best way to learn a skill and am very excited to continue this journey while working on projects from which the community of Fort Collins benefits.
