I am Isaiah Torain, and I am a recent graduate from Colorado State University. I am from Colorado Springs, CO and have been developing since I started school although I was "hacking" on things since I was a tike. I joined CodeForFoco to sharpen my developer skills, expand my network, and of course contribute to the community of Fort Collins by doing something I love! Check me out on [Github](https://github.com/itorain) or you can see my photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zay_apollo/) (sorry, no fb or twitter). Also drop by my [personal blog](http://dev.zaylabs.me).
