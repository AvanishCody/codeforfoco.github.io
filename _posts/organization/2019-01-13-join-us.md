## Join Code for Fort Collins

Code for Fort Collins (Code for FoCo) is the first northern Colorado brigade of the [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/). As an independent brigade, we work to improve our community by building technologies and capacities that we feel will help our city and region.

Code for Fort Collins started July of 2016. and are proud that our first project was for the [Fort Collins Bike Coop](http://fcbikecoop.org/). We have since completed a number of successful projects and have ongoing collaborations with Northern Colorado community organizations.
