### Code for Fort Collins / Code for America relationship
Code for Fort Collins (CFFC) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Code for America. The MOU specifies (among other things) that Code for America will act as a fiduciary for CFFC. This means that CFFC does not exist as an independent legal entity, and uses Code for America for all money matters. Practically that means we raise to them, and then spend seperately, getting reimbursed by them. There are reasonable limits on reimbursable expenses as a bridgade as defined in the MOU.
