# Why Donate to Code for Fort Collins?
Though the members of the Code for Fort Collins donate our time for free, we need support for incidental costs. We are grateful that our partnership with the Poudre River Library provides us with free space. Be we're humans in need of some food & drinks to juice our meeting attendence and drive volunteers to stay engaged. We also need to cover a few technical tools from time to time, like ways to export old database or connect with a cool new one.

## Code for Fort Collins / Code for America relationship
Code for Fort Collins (CFFC) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Code for America. The MOU specifies (among other things) that Code for America will act as a fiduciary for CFFC. This means that CFFC does not exist as an independent legal entity, and uses Code for America for all money matters. Practically that means we raise money through them, spend seperately, and are getting reimbursed by them. There are many reasonable limits on reimbursable expenses as a bridgade which are defined in the MOU.
