## About Code for Fort Collins
Code for Fort Coillns is a brigade of Code for America, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 2009. We organize around the idea of civic engagement and volunteer projects to help improve and support the local government, charities, and other groups dedicated to improving our society. We are local programmers, hackers, and just about anyone that wants to help that came together in 2016 to bring Code for America to Fort Collins.

## Why Donate to Code for Fort Collins?
Though the members of the Code for Fort Collins donate our time for free, we need support for incidental costs. We're super grateful for Cohere's donation of meeting space. But we also have needs for paying the costs of some technical tools and hosting. And we're in need of some food & drinks to juice our meeting attendence and drive volunteers to stay engaged. Our group relies on the support of the community around us to keep us vibrant.
