Below is a list of our next four upcoming Meetups, or you can view the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Fort-Collins/?scroll=true" title="Code for Foco Meetup schedule" target="_blank">full schedule</a>. Typically we meet at Mesh (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mesh+Fort+Collins/@40.588476,-105.0764007,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smesh+fort+collins!3m4!1s0x87694a8b439eb3d9:0xd690ab6ed3d1a91!8m2!3d40.588476!4d-105.074212" target="_blank" title="Google Maps">located</a> in Old Town) every Thursday at 6:30pm, with three meetings a month dedicated to hacking on projects and the fourth to on-boarding new members. Feel free to attend any night, of course, as the meetings often spill into varying topics anyway!
