Below is a list of our next four upcoming Meetups, or you can view the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Fort-Collins/?scroll=true" title="Code for Foco Meetup schedule" target="_blank">full schedule</a>. Typically we meet at every Thursday at 6:30pm, and the location may vary so keep an eye on the Meetup site for accurate details.

Three meetings a month are usually dedicated to working on projects, and the fourth to on-boarding new members, but feel free to attend any night!
