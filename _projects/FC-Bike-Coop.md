### Project Details
The Fort Collins Bike Co-op is a volunteer organization dedicated to keeping Fort Collins biking. To do this they provide classes, refurbish and donate bikes, and divert good bikes from going to the landfill.

The Bike Co-op had a volunteer-created site which was functional but hard for them to consistently maintain. The site also looked a little dated.

To help, we created a new site for the Bike Co-op using WordPress, a popular open-source content management system. The WordPress site is easier to volunteers to access and change, and looks nice to boot. WordPress is user-friendly and popular enough, so it's likely that current and future volunteers will be comfortable stepping in to update it. We created a way that they can connect to their Facebook events and keep the community more easily informed about what's going on and what they need to know.

We also built a custom plugin to integrate with their internal database tools where they track volunteers, analytics, and more. These tools will help them make the transition to doing more with WordPress and relying on it handle their needs going forward.
