Homeward 2020 wanted to start to compile reports about long-term homelessness. Gudrun jumped at the opportunity to use a cool new tool: Tableau, and make a great report. The team from Homeward 2020 (Holly Le Maseurier and Marla from the Murphy Center) did the hard work of collecting all the data, but we helped them with the tech side. And we still do a bit of WordPress support from time to time :)
